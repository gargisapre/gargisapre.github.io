			<h2>Current</h2>
	      <p> CS 410: Compiler Techniques</p>
                  <p1> This course explores the basic problems in the translation of programming languages focusing on 
			  theory and common implementation techniques for compiling traditional block structured programming 
			  languages to produce assembly or object code for typical machines.</p>	
	      <p> CS 345: Databases</p>
                  <p1> Provides a comprehensive introduction to the use of data management systems within the context of various applications</p>
              <p> CS 311: Introduction to Algorithms</p>
                  <p1> Introduction to algorithms in a variety of areas of interest, such as sorting, searching, string-processing, and graph algorithms.</p>
     	      
			<h2>Previous</h2>
	      <p> CS 325: Human Computer Interaction</p>
                  <p1> Examine the important problems in Usability, Human Computer Interaction, User Interfaces and Human Centered Computing.</p1>
	      <p> CS 240: Reasoning Under Uncertainty</p>
                  <p1>Development of mathematical reasoning skills for problems that involve uncertainty.</p1>
