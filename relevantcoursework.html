            <h1>Relevant Coursework</h1>
			<h2>Current</h2>
	      <p> CS 345: Databases</p>
                  <p1> Provides a comprehensive introduction to the use of data management systems within the context of various applications</p>
              <p> CS 311: Introduction to Algorithms</p>
                  <p1> Introduction to algorithms in a variety of areas of interest, such as sorting, searching, string-processing, and graph algorithms.</p>
              <p> CS 590V: Data Visualization and Exploration </p>
                  <p1>  Introduction to multiple aspects of data presentation including human perception and design theory; algorithms for exploring patterns in data such as topic modeling, clustering, and dimensionality reduction.</p>
               
			<h2>Previous</h2>
	      <p> CS 325: Human Computer Interaction</p>
                  <p1> Examine the important problems in Usability, Human Computer Interaction, User Interfaces and Human Centered Computing.</p1>
	      <p> CS 240: Reasoning Under Uncertainty</p>
                  <p1>Development of mathematical reasoning skills for problems that involve uncertainty.</p1>
              <p> CS 230: Computer Systems Principles</p>
                  <p1>Study the scientific principles behind the construction of high-performance, scalable systems. The course begins with a discussion of C language, and moves up the stack from there to the features of modern architectures, 
                  assembly languages, and operating system services such as I/O and synchronization.</p1>
              <p> CS 220: Programming Methodology</p>
                  <p1>Designing, implementing, testing and modifying larger programs, including: use of integrated design environments, 
                  design strategies and patterns, testing, working with large code bases and libraries, code refactoring, and use of debuggers and 
                  tools for version control.</p1>
              <p> CS 187: Data Structures</p>
                  <p1>Learning the basic principles of designing and implementing common data structures in Java.</p1>
              <p> STAT 515: Statistics I </p>
                  <p1>This courses provides a calculus based introduction to probability (an emphasis on probabilistic concepts used in statistical modeling) and the beginning of statistical inference</p1>
	      <p> CS 383: Artificial Intelligence</p>
	          <p1> The Course explores key concepts of artificial intelligence, including problem solving, state-space 
			  representation, heuristic search techniques, game playing, knowledge representation, logical reasoning, 
			  automated planning, reasoning under uncertainty, decision theory and machine learning.</p1>
	       <p> CS 250: Introduction to Computation</p>	
		  <p1>Undergraduate core course in discrete mathematics and will deal with logic, elementary number theory, proof by 
			  induction, recursion on trees, search algorithms, finite state machines, and a bit of computability. </p1>
