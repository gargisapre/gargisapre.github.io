        		<h1>ScannerApp.io</h1>
				<p>This is an app I designed over summer 2016 as a software engineering intern for LexusNexus. This project was a proof of concept application
            that would allow users to be authenticated via telerik backend services. It would then allow users to scan a barcode and place 
            an order through a company server. This server would send push notifications to the user at different stages. <a href="https://github.com/gargisapre/GargiAApp.io">Click Here</a> for github repository</p>
            
            <h1>Activity Tracker</h1>
        <p>This is a website application I am currently working on as an intern for the Boston Road Runners. This application will
			allow users to login and track their daily physical activities as well as their progress with monthly challenges.</p>
        
            <h1>Encryption Application</h1>
        <p>This is an Android application that me and one of my peers designed during HackUmass 2015. We designed this app more as
        a means for learning how to use Android Studio, and learn how to write code in XML and CSS. At the end, we were able to develop
        an application that would encrypt and decrypt messages based on certain ciphers that we coded into the application. <a href="https://github.com/katmayo7/HackUMassIII">Click Here</a> for github repository</p>
